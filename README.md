# Pro3
Project 3 test

This is what I have thus far.

7 classes, 4 interfaces, 1 txt file... all in one package

I have provided the expected output under the file "output"

Note that the file paths are set to my machine, so the program won't run unless you update the paths in the main class (line 20 for "Palindrome.java", and line 36 for "reversedWords.txt"
